cochrane-nlp-experiments
========================

experiment code to go with the *dev* branch (at the moment) of the cochrane-nlp code

**NOTE**
- This requires cochrane-nlp to be accessible as a module
- To do this
    - clone cochrane-nlp into a 'cochranenlp' directory (note no hyphen to conform with python module naming)
    - add the directory containing cochranenlp to the $PYTHONPATH environment variable, e.g. at the command line: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/bwallace/dev/cochrane/`.
